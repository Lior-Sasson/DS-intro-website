Data is everywhere. It's everything you can draw conclusions from- whether it's numbers, images, vidoes, audio, text... Every photo you upload to Facebook, every voice messege you send on Whatsapp.It's no surprise that in the last decade, the global growth of data volume has gone off the charts. Google processes more that 20 PB per day. Facebook has more than 60 TB of daily logs.The act of saving data in computers has become a comfortable habit. Whereas in the past, organizations used to keep countless ring binders, today it's much more convenient to save the data in organized computer folders- it's easier to access data and to keep it safely in the long term. Plenty of data is being collected and warehoused: web data, e-commerce, financial transactions, social networks and so on.This has caused exponential growth in computer data, ready for all to process and analyse and so to draw insights of workflows and processes. This has made organizations become more knowledgable, efficient, save money and create new and usefull work positions.
