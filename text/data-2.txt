This is also one of the main factors that made Data Science possible... but data wasn't not enough. Data Science wasn't very popular up until the last decade or so. The basic data science equation- gradient descent, which is the foundation for many advanced data science algorithms, was created back in 1847.So what changed? Of course, the availabilty of data, but processing large amounts of data required strong computing power.

Moore's law indicates that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. That means that the processing power increases exponentially, and so it also becomes cheaper and more accessible.
